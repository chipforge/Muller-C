## Requirements

### Schematics and Symbols

For the graphical Schematics of the cells and their Symbols the Xschem tool by Stefan Schippers is used. Xschem is dedicated to VLSI design and allows to export the cells directly into Verilog HDL, VHDL or Spice. Install Xschem on Debian by

```
apt-get install xschem
```

### Simulation

For simulation Icarus Verilog and NGspice are used; sailing (also) under the gEDA flag. Use

```
apt-get install iverilog gtkwave ngspice gwave
```
